# The Hunter

The big mother is weak now. Fading. They say she could be sick. I really don't know. It sent us fewer beams yesterday. And today she have to fight with that dark cloud.

I was lucky. That silly tree crossed the grass and wandered deep into our ground. Maybe he was looking for the food too. With so little leaves he must be starving. He realised the threat too late. Runs really fast, but I am the fastest here. Except the wind of course.

The tribe is quiet now. Resting. Stuffed little over the limit. But the cold is scary. We have to be ready stand the cold.
