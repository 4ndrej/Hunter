# The Hunter

### The big mother is weak now. Fading. They say she could be sick. I really don't know. It sent us fewer beams last week. And today she have to fight with that dark cloud. I hope it will get well soon.

### The legend said this is normal. Just another cycle like thousand times before. The Legend. Only fool will trust an old legend.

### We are scared.

### I was lucky today.

### That silly tree crossed the grass and wandered deep into our ground. Maybe he was looking for the food too. With so little leaves he must be starving. Maybe insane.

### He realised the threat too late. Runs really fast, but I am the fastest here. Except the wind of course.

### Screaming is useless here.

### Then came my sisters. We scattered the fool over the ground.

### The tribe is quiet now. Resting. We have to wait now. Within few days we will be stuffed up to the limit.

### The cold is scary. We have to be prepared.
